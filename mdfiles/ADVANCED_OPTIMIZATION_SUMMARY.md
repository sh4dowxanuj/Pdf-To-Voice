  - Increased page limit from 10 to 15 pages
  - Reduced bitmap size for better performance (2048x2048 → 1024x1024)
- **Stream Optimization**: Using buffered streams with automatic resource cleanup

### 4. Build System Optimizations
- **Enhanced Kotlin Compilation**: Added experimental coroutines and time optimizations
- **ProGuard Enhancements**: 
  - 5-pass optimization
  - Access modification allowed
  - Arithmetic simplification disabled for better compatibility
- **Advanced Build Config**: MultiDex disabled for faster builds when not needed

### 5. UI Performance Improvements
- **Sequence-based Processing**: Lazy text splitting for better memory usage
- **Enhanced Memoization**: Smarter segment matching with early exits
- **Optimized State Management**: Reduced unnecessary recompositions
- **Hierarchical Matching**: Fast exact match → substring → word-based fallback

### 6. Memory Monitoring & Diagnostics
- **Real-time Memory Tracking**: PerformanceUtils for comprehensive monitoring
- **Garbage Collection Integration**: Smart GC triggering for memory cleanup

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Cache Optimization
```kotlin
// LRU Cache with automatic eviction
private val segmentCache = object : LinkedHashMap<String, List<String>>(16, 0.75f, true) {
    override fun removeEldestEntry(eldest: MutableMap.MutableEntry<String, List<String>>?): Boolean {
        return size > MAX_CACHE_SIZE
    }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```kotlin
// Real-time memory tracking
PerformanceUtils.logMemoryUsage(context, TAG)
PerformanceUtils.measureTime(TAG, "PDF text extraction") {
    pdfProcessor.extractTextWithDetails(uri)
}
```

### Lazy Processing
```kotlin
// Sequence-based text processing
state.extractedText
    .splitToSequence(Regex("(?<=[.!?])\\s+|\\n"))
    .filter { it.isNotBlank() }
    .map { it.trim() }
    .toList()
```
