?? Android App Idea Prompt: PDF to Voice Reader
I am building an Android app that converts PDF files into speech using Text-to-Speech (TTS).
The goal is to allow users to import any PDF document from local storage, extract the text, and have it read aloud. I want the app to support the following features:

? Features:
File picker to select a PDF from device storage

Extract text from PDF pages (even multi-page PDFs)

Play, pause, and stop voice playback

Use Androidï¿½s built-in TextToSpeech engine

Highlight current line or sentence being read (optional)

Support for different voice speeds and pitch (optional)

Basic UI with buttons and display of current text

?? Tech Preferences:
Language: Kotlin or Java (prefer Kotlin)

PDF Library: Androidï¿½s PdfRenderer, Apache PDFBox, or MuPDF

TTS Engine: Android's native TextToSpeech

?? Goals:
Offline support (no internet required for core functionality)

Clean and simple design for accessibility and ease of use

Modular codebase for future improvements

Iï¿½m looking for a basic working prototype that:

Opens a PDF

Extracts and reads the text aloud

Has basic controls (play/pause/stop)
